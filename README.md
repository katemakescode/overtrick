## Mercantile

Mercantile is an eCommerce "bookstore". It is intended as a demonstration of development skill, and does not in fact sell books.

Currently, only the first stage has been completed, where the user can enter a search term, and the site will
retrieve and display data from the Google Books API for books matching that term.

Mercantile is built using React.js, React-Bootstrap, Django and Django REST Framework.
